DND Assistant is an attempt to make a better DND helper app. Contributions are
welcome!

## Contributing

### Install

You'll need to install `yarn` first.

```
$ yarn install
```

### Web Development Server

To launch the web development server run:

```
$ yarn web
```

This launches `webpack-dev-server`.

### Build Web Prod

```
$ yarn webprod
```

### Android Development


To start the android bundle server:

```
$ yarn start
```

To install the app on a connected device:

```
yarn android
```


### Coding Style

Please follow the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/rules.html).

All code is packaged using webpack, babel, and ES6 modules.

### iOS

Currently not supported. I'd love to have someone migrate it however. It
shouldn't be too much work, I just don't have a development device or
environment.
